					<h1>Deceased Estates</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h3>The origin of a deceased estate</h3>
                    <p>Winding up of an estate comes into effect when a person dies leaving property, assets or a
                        document which is a will. Such estate must then be administered and distributed in terms of
                        the deceased's will or failing a valid will, in terms of the Intestate Succession Act, 81 of
                        1987.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                       <h3>To which Master must the estate be reported?</h3>
                       <p><b>One must distinguish between those instances where the deceased was resident within the
                        Republic and those where he or she was not resident within the Republic.
                    </b>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Where the deceased was resident in the Republic, the estate must be reported to the
                                Master in whose area of jurisdiction the deceased was resident at the time of his/her
                                death. At present there are Master's Offices in Pretoria, Cape Town, Pietermaritzburg,
                                Grahamstown, Bisho, Umtata, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Mmabatho/Mafikeng,
                                Johannesburg, Polokwane, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Thohoyandou and Nelspruit.</li>
                                <li>Where the deceased was not resident in the Republic at the time of his/her death, the
                                    estate may be reported to any Master, provided it is reported to only one Master. An
                                    affidavit to the effect that the letters of executorship have not already been granted by
                                    any other Master in the Republic must accompany the reporting documents.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>



                      

                        <p><b>The following estates will be transferred to the Master's Office, namely:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Estates with wills.</li>
                                    <li>Estates with a value of <b> more than R250 000.</b></li>
                                    <li>Insolvent estates.</li>
                                    <li>Estates where one or more of the beneficiaries are minors and is not assisted by a legal
                                        guardian and the cash assets in the estate is worth more than R20 000.</li>
                                </ul>

                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    
                        <h3>To which Master must the estate be reported?</h3>

                        <p>The death is to be reported by any person having control or possession of any property or
                            document being a will, of the deceased. The estate is reported by lodging a completed Death
                            Notice and other related documents with the Master.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The reporting documents will differ slightly depending on the value of the estate and the type
                            of appointment required. If the value of the <b> estate exceeds R250 000,</b> letters of executorship
                            must be issued and the full process prescribed by the Administration of Estates Act must be
                            followed. If the value of the estate is under R250 000,00 then the representative of the estate
                            will make an application to the Master for a letter of authority.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                        <h3>Why you need an appraiser?</h3>

                        <p>When property has to be valued in a deceased estate, it is normally done by an appraiser.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Appraisers are appointed for specific areas by the Minister of Justice and Constitutional
Development in terms of section 6 of the Administration of Estates Act no. 66 of
1965. Appraisers are entitled to a reasonable remuneration which is determined by a
prescribed tariff of fees. When there is a dispute regarding the correctness of the
remuneration charged, the appraisers account must be submitted to the Master for taxation.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                        <h3>Wills</h3>

                        <p>A will is a specialized document, which should preferably be drawn up by an expert like an
                            attorney, trust company etc.</p>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Intestate succession</h3>

                        <p>Any person of 16 years and over is free to make a will in order to determine how his/her
                            estate should devolve upon his/her death. If you die without a will, your estate will devolve in
                            terms of the rules of intestate succession, that is in accordance with your successors.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Once the Master has issued the Letters of Executorship the following steps will be taken to
finalise the winding up process:-</b>
<ol>
    <li>Advertisement of debtors and creditors in the local newspaper and
        government gazette. The advert shall be open for a period of 30 days during
        which time all the debtors and creditors can lodge a claim against the estate
        with the executor.</li>
    <li>After 30 days a document called liquidation and distribution account is
        drafted, signed by the executor and thereafter submitted to the Master for
        approval.</li>
    <li>Once you have obtained the Master's consent to proceed, the liquidation and
        distribution account is advertised in the local newspaper and government
        gazette and is laid open for inspection at the Magistrate's Court for 21 days</li>
    <li>The public can view the liquidation and distribution account and lodge an
        objection if they do not agree to any amounts stipulated on the documents.</li>
    <li>Upon expiry of the 21 days and should there be no objections raised, the
        Master will forward a certificate to the executor confirming that the estate is
        free from any objection.</li>
    <li>Thereafter the executor can proceed to the next step which could either be
        paying out inheritances to the heirs or transferring of a property to an heir.</li>
    <li>Once a property has been transferred and funds paid out, the executor signs an
        affidavit to confirm the above and the estate has been finalised and request the
        Master to release him /her from the appointment of executor.</li>
</ol>
